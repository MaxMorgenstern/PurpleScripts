Troubleshooting:

Purple Scripts have been tested with several different systems but there is still a slight chance that some errors occur.

This are the most common issues:



Error:
Unhandled Exception: System.Reflection.ReflectionTypeLoadException: The classes in the module cannot be loaded.
Solution:
Change the API Compatibility level from „.NET 2.0 Subnet“ to „.NET 2.0“


Error:
Internal compiler error. ... Could not load file or assembly 'System.Drawing, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.
Solution:
Change the API Compatibility level from „.NET 2.0 Subnet“ to „.NET 2.0“


Error:
There are no Unit Tests within the project.
Solution:
Add „UnityTestToolsIsPresent“ to the „Scripting Define Symbols“ section.


Error:
The type or namespace 'NUnit' could not be found.
Solution:
Remove „UnityTestToolsIsPresent“ from the „Scripting Define Symbols“ section.
OR Install Unity Test Tools in order to enable Unit testing.
